## Mae is going to help:
Lets create a few resources to help folks understand the project better. Phil gave a presentation about it at VM Workshop that included a demo (I was able to live tweet from that session). Why don’t we host a webinar specifically for ConsoleZ? Then we’ll be able to post the webinar recording on our Youtube channel and promote it in social media. This might help drum up interest….

If you are available, I can slot you in for later this month. We can do Tuesday, Sept. 21 at 9-10 am PDT. Does that work for you?
